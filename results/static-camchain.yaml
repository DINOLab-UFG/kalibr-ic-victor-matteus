# The camera intrinsics are parameters that define the internal characteristics 
# of the camera lens and sensor. These parameters are essential for many computer vision tasks such as 3D 
# reconstruction, camera calibration, and image rectification. 

# Both cameras use a "pinhole" camera model, which is a standard model used in computer vision that approximates 
# the way light rays pass through the camera lens and form an image on the sensor.
